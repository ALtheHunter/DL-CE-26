Link to arXiv Preprint: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.12445

Code, results and data is structured with reference to the paper as given below:

/code - Contains /train to perform GAN and LOS Predictor trainings as described in Section IV and /test to perform Generative Channel Estimation as described in Section III
/results - Follows structure of Section VI-A through VI-D.
/data - Contains all the test data files, DFT matrices and (precoder, combiner, symbol) triplet used for Pilot GAN trainings. Download the training data from the URL given in /data/README.md
