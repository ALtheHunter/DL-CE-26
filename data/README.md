Download training data from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BJAdkDBT2DfC889kPIiJWg2efhOHDS78?usp=sharing to this folder.

Details of training and testing data can be found in Section V-A.

To generate data on your own, run clean_channel_5G.m in Matlab (change parpool depending on the compute power availibility), followed by merge_data.m. Do this for each of the CDL channel models.
